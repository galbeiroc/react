# react

React is library for building user interfaces.

React = Declarative UI Programming. With React we define target UI state - not the steps to get there

## Using "Just JS" isn't a Great Option

* It quickly becomes *cumbersome*
* It quickly becomes *error-prone*
* It quickly becomes *hard to mantain* or edit
* *React* offers a way simpler *Mental Model*

React Projects use a Build Process that transform our code.

### Why use Variables?

1. Reusability: store value in a variable => Don't repeat yourself
2. Readability: organize our code over several lines

### What is a Component?

Components are reusable building blocks in our user interface. Component are in the end just a combination of `HTML` code, `CSS` code styling and possibly `Javascript` code for some logic.
React is all about components.

### How is a Component Built?

React allow us to create re-usable and reactive components components consisting HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
React uses something which is Declarative approach for buiding these components, that means we dont tell react that a certain HTML element should be created and insertin in a specific place on the user interface as we would be doing it with Vanilla JS. Instead with React we will always define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.
